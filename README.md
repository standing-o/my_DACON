# my DACON
- All the DACON competitions I participated in
- Apr. 29, 2022 ~ Present

-----------------------------------
### Dataset
- The directory structure of all competitions follows:
~~~
Dacon-competition/
├── Competition_code.ipynb
├── submissions.csv
└── /dataset
    ├── train.csv
    ├── test.csv
    ├── sample_submission.csv
~~~

- `train.csv` is the training data and `test.csv` is the test data. And neither can be shared due to data security.
- We make `submissions.csv` using `test.csv`.
- All `ipynb` notebooks are created in the Colab environment.
